### Movie Analysis
The dataset provided is related to IMDB Movies. A potential problem to investigate could be: "What factors influence the success of a movie on IMDB?" Here, success can be defined by high IMDB ratings. The impact of this problem is significant for movie producers, directors, and investors who want to understand what makes a movie successful to make informed decisions in their future projects. The data source is google.

We have data containing movie name, directors, actors, budget, gross, imdb score etc. I analysed the data using Power BI. Before analysing I cleaned the data by removing the duplicates.

First I looked into the Genre list and found out which is the Genre in which most of the movies are made.Comedy, Action and Drama are the top 3 genres in the industry. Now we can check the IMDB scores on specific genres.

Eventhough most of the movies are made in Action, Comedy and Drama genre, the highest imdb scores are for the genre History, Documentary and Biography. Mostly the films in this genre are not commercial filims. The highest ImDB scores indicate the quality of the filim. 

Now lets look into the influence of directors. Here many directors have an average IMDB Scores above 8.5. When we dive deep into the relation between budget, profit and IMDB Scores its clear that budget have no relation with IMDB score. They are not correlated. We can see scenarios where high budget films have low profit and IMDB Scores. It is evident that films with IMDB Score above 8.5 have mighest profit. Also films in the genre Musical, family, animation, horror have more profit than other genre.

We can check the budget and profit relation with respect to each genre using an interactive report. [Report](https://app.powerbi.com/links/nywHjCcYKB?ctid=48982c93-be9a-4edc-b6c3-23c9093d7403&pbi_source=linkShare&bookmarkGuid=7e0475a0-11d5-48a6-872f-cfab11f6d092)
