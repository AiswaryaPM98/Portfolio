### 1. AD Campaign Analysis
This is a project that I worked on as part of internship. Here we have data of various advertisement campaign the company did for the clients. As a part of digital marketing the data includes the cities, device used, clicks, impression, click through rate (CTR), average cost per click (CPC), conversions, cost per conversion, conversion rate and Absolute top impression. I was assigned to analyse the data and create a dashboard. Here I used Power Bi for analysis.

What I found out from the analysis :
1. Digital marketing reaches out mostly via mobile phones and computer.
2.

### 2. Movie Analysis
The dataset provided is related to IMDB Movies. A potential problem to investigate could be: "What factors influence the success of a movie on IMDB?" Here, success can be defined by high IMDB ratings. The impact of this problem is significant for movie producers, directors, and investors who want to understand what makes a movie successful to make informed decisions in their future projects. The data source is google.

We have data containing movie name, directors, actors, budget, gross, imdb score etc. I analysed the data in Microsoft Excel and visualised in Power BI. Before analysing I cleaned the data by removing the duplicates.

First I looked into the Genre list and found out which is the Genre in which most of the movies are made.Comedy, Action and Drama are the top 3 genres in the industry. Now we can check the IMDB scores on specific genres.

Eventhough most of the movies are made in Action, Comedy and Drama genre, the highest imdb scores are for the genre History, Documentary and Biography. Mostly the films in this genre are not commercial filims. The highest ImDB scores indicate the quality of the filim. 

Now lets look into the influence of directors. Here many directors have an average IMDB Scores above 8.5. When we dive deep into the relation between budget, profit and IMDB Scores its clear that budget have no relation with IMDB score. They are not correlated. We can see scenarios where high budget films have low profit and IMDB Scores. It is evident that films with IMDB Score above 8.5 have mighest profit. Also films in the genre Musical, family, animation, horror have more profit than other genre.

We can check the budget and profit relation with respect to each genre using an interactive report. [Report](https://app.powerbi.com/links/nywHjCcYKB?ctid=48982c93-be9a-4edc-b6c3-23c9093d7403&pbi_source=linkShare&bookmarkGuid=7e0475a0-11d5-48a6-872f-cfab11f6d092)

**Conclusion :**

•	Mostly commercial films are made in the genre comedy, action and drama. Most profited genre is adventure. 

•	Highest IMDB scores are for the genre documentary, thriller, sci-fi, family, western and the number of movies released in those genre is very few compared to others.

•	Top Directors with average imdb score above 8.5 have released only few films.

•	Budget and Earnings of a film is not at all connected to each other.

Quality of the film matters more than anything no matter how much the budget is. Those directors make only few films. Films from other genre apart from common genre like drama comedy, action scores high in IMDB. For commercial profit comedy, adventure and action would be best.
