### Movie Analysis
The dataset provided is related to IMDB Movies. A potential problem to investigate could be: "What factors influence the success of a movie on IMDB?" Here, success can be defined by high IMDB ratings. The impact of this problem is significant for movie producers, directors, and investors who want to understand what makes a movie successful to make informed decisions in their future projects. 

We have data containing movie name, directors, actors, budget, gross, imdb score etc. I analysed the data using Power BI. Before analysing I cleaned the data by removing the duplicates.

First I looked into the Genre list and found out which is the Genre in which most of the movies are made.

Comedy, Action and Drama are the top 3 genres in the industry. Now we can check the IMDB scores on specific genres.
